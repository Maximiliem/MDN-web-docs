Anatomy of a CSS ruleset:
p {
    color: red;
}


The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:

Selector

    This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.


Declaration

    This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.


Properties

    These are features of an HTML element that you can change the values of, to make it styled differently. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.


Property value

    To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)



Note the other important parts of the syntax:

    Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})
    Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.
    Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.



To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:
p {
  color: red;
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}


Selecting multiple elements:
You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:

p,
li,
h1 {
  color: red;
}


Different types of selectors

There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types of selectors:

Selector name 	What does it select 	Example

Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector) 	All HTML elements of the specified type. 	p selects <p>

ID selector 	The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique. 	#my-id selects <p id="my-id"> or <a id="my-id">

Class selector 	The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page. 	.my-class selects <p class="my-class"> and <a class="my-class">

Attribute selector 	The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute. 	img[src]
selects <img src="my-image.png"> but not <img>

Pseudo-class selector 	The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.) 	a:hover selects <a>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.
